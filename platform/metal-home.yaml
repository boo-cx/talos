# This metal platform config sets the upstream DNS and NTP servers.
#
# Config is applied to the installer image via the kernel cmdline and written to the META partition on
# installation. This ensures parameters are set both before and after installation.
#
# Post-installation changes to these parameters requires altering the META partition using Talos API.
